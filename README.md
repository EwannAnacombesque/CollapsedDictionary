# CollapsedDictionary
Wave Function Collapse Algorithm applied on text, can generate words or fill gaps in words.  
User can choose between different corpora, enter the beginning of a word and let the dictionary complete it, or enter a gapped word.  
Watch an illustration on my youtube channel [here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qmzXaZhqYI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qmzXaZhqYI)

## Graphical User Interface
The GUI has been done with pygame, it is fully generated live. No images are used, it's all dependant of the screen size.

## Examples
See some examples in the Example folder, some words are generated from the french corpus.  
Like are [those ones : Rêveuter, Rêvainer, Rêvanter...](https://github.com/EwannAnacombesque/CollapsedDictionary/blob/main/Examples/R%C3%AAv_____er%20tris.txt)
